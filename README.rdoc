= geoplanet

A Ruby wrapper for the Yahoo! GeoPlanet APIs. It's inspired on Mattt Thompson's yahoo-geoplanet gem,
but this version supports better usage of matrix and query parameters, uses JSON for API communication to minimize bandwidth usage, supports both short & long versions of a place, and supports multiple languages.

== Usage

=== Searching for a Location:

  require 'geoplanet'
  GeoPlanet.appid = [Your App ID Here]
  
  # Search for places that matches "Springfield" (the API returns 1 by default)
  GeoPlanet::Place.search("Springfield")
  
  # Search for *all* places that matches "Springfield"
  GeoPlanet::Place.search("Springfield", :count => 0)
  
  # You can pass in any Matrix or Query parameters this way too
  # For more details see the following URLs:
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#matrix_parameters
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#query_parameters
  
=== Initializing by Where On Earth ID && Associations
  
  require 'geoplanet'
  GeoPlanet.appid = [Your App ID Here]
  
  a = GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067) # WoE ID for Algeciras
  
  # Everything you get back from the API you have direct access to
  # through the Place object. For example:
  
  a.version          # "long"
  a.placetype        # "Town"
  a.placetype_code   # 7
  a.admin1           # "Andalucia"
  a.admin1_code      # "ES-AN"
  a.admin1_placetype # "Autonomous Community"
  a.admin2           # "Cadiz"
  a.admin2_code      # ""
  a.admin2_placetype # "Province"
  a.latitude         # 36.127602
                     # Latitude and Longitude are values at Centroid
  a.bounding_box     # [[36.109779, -5.47725], [36.164268, -5.43527]]
                     # Bounding box are SW / NE coordinates in array
  
  # We unlock the true power of GeoPlanet with association collections
  # Check out this truly amazing stuff:
  
  # A list of other towns in the area
  a.siblings
  
  # A complete hierarchy, from country down to municipality
  a.ancestors

  # Postal Codes at Algeciras
  a.children(:select => "long", :type => 11)
  
  # You can use multiple types on the same query.
  # e.g. Country and Province for Algeciras
  a.belongtos(:type => [12, 9])
  
  # You can specify the language you want for the results.
  a.belongtos(:type => 12, :lang => 'es_ES').first.name  # España
  
  a = GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067, :lang => :es)
  a.country  # España
  
  # It is also possible to query for any association directly using a WOE ID, without
  # create a Place object. Append a '_of' suffix to the association name to build the
  # method name to execute. The first argument is the WOE ID.
  
  GeoPlanet::Place.belongtos_of(752067, :type => [12, 9])

=== Debug Mode

If you want to look at the requests that are being executed against the Yahoo GeoPlanet API, you can enable the debug mode. It uses the standard output.

  GeoPlanet.debug = true
  GeoPlanet::Place.new(752067, :lang => :es)
  # outputs:
  # Yahoo GeoPlanet: GET http://where.yahooapis.com/v1/place/752067?appid=[your_appid]&format=json&lang=es


== REQUIREMENTS:

To use this library, you must have a valid Yahoo! App ID. 
You can get one at http://developer.yahoo.com/wsregapp/

Additionally, geoplanet has the following gem dependencies:

* rest-client >= 0.9
* json >= 1.1.3

Please note that if you have ActiveSupport::JSON defined (either by
manually having loaded it or when you use geoplanet within a Rails
application) the json dependency will be ignored and geoplanet uses
ActiveSupport::JSON instead.

== INSTALL:

* gem install rabble-geoplanet --source http://gems.github.com
